# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### My React Learning Journey

One of the most exciting projects I built while learning React is the Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project helped me deeply understand React fundamentals like useState, component reusability, and passing props between parent and child components. I also learned how to manage game logic, handle user interactions efficiently, and display real-time status updates like the next player or the winner. It was a great exercise in combining logic with UI design, while keeping the code structured and easy to follow through proper documentation.

Before that, I built a Text-Utils app, a lightweight tool that allows users to manipulate text â€” converting case, clearing text, copying results, and more. It taught me how to work with state, props, and event handling in React to create responsive, utility-driven interfaces.

I also created a News App that dynamically fetches and displays hundreds of daily news articles across multiple categories. This project helped me understand API integration, dynamic routing, and efficient rendering of large datasets.

Each of these projects has played a key role in my React learning journey, strengthening my understanding of component-based development and real-world problem solving.
